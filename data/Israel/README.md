## Israel data
# Israel_ministry_of_health.csv
This is a merged data for official reports. I tried to make it consistent with the table kept by  [tsvikas](https://github.com/tsvikas/COVID-19-Israel-data/blob/master/daily_reports/total_cases.csv), while integrating data from the [xlsx](https://govextra.gov.il/media/16870/covid19-data-israel.xlsx) release from the government's [website](https://govextra.gov.il/ministry-of-health/corona/corona-virus/).<br>
The xlsx file has daily summaries (at midnight I presume) while the rest of the data is mainly morning and evening updates. These have more info compared to the xslx file, like the number of recovered patients. Recently I started to collect more info from the website, such as the number of home-care patients. So different rows have different info, depending on what was available.
