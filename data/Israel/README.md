## Israel data
# Israel_ministry_of_health.csv
[Israel_ministry_of_health.csv](https://github.com/yuval-harpaz/covid-19_data_analysis/blob/master/data/Israel/Israel_ministry_of_health.csv) is a merged data for official reports. I checked consistency with the tables kept by  [tsvikas](https://github.com/tsvikas/COVID-19-Israel-data/blob/master/daily_reports/total_cases.csv), while integrating data from PDF and PNG files posted on Ministry Of Health telegram [@MOHreport](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@MOHreport) channel and from their [website](https://govextra.gov.il/ministry-of-health/corona/corona-virus/). In addition, PDF files with morning reading history provided the cumulative critical condition. This information was last updated on [03 May](https://github.com/yuval-harpaz/covid-19_data_analysis/blob/master/data/Israel/MOHreport_03_05_2020_time_0900.pdf).<br>
You may also want to compare with [idandrd](https://github.com/idandrd/israel-covid19-data/blob/master/IsraelCOVID19.csv), although this table seems to include only the morning count.<br>
In addition to Telegram and webpage sources, the ministry of health publishes a history sheet in [xlsx](https://github.com/yuval-harpaz/covid-19_data_analysis/blob/master/data/Israel/covid19-data-israel.xlsx) format (see a link on the [web page](https://govextra.gov.il/ministry-of-health/corona/corona-virus/)) and a similar [json](https://data.gov.il/api/action/datastore_search?resource_id=e4bf0ab8-ec88-4f9b-8669-f2cc78273edd) report downloadable from the big-data team (Timna) [resources](https://data.gov.il/dataset/covid-19). These data are issued in delay and are inconsistent with the real-time reports, but they may be more accurate.

# Issues
* I tried to make the data consistent with the history xlsx release (published with missing data for the week before) but it was impossible because the numbers are inconsistent. The xlsx file has daily summaries (at midnight I presume) while the rest of the data is mainly morning and evening updates, but some numbers seem wrong, like drops in the cumulative death count when you compare the xlsx to other reports.<br>
* Some mild condition (and possibly asimptomatic) patients were isolated in "COVID-19 hotels". Others were sent for home-care, which is different than home-isolation. The numbers for home-care and hotel-isolation were reported seperately, but from some point they have been added up. The main problem is that the mild patients initially included home-care, hotel-isolated and some hospitalized mild cases, whereas now the latter are excluded from the count (mild = home+hotel), at least for the website reports. In [Israel_ministry_of_health.csv](https://github.com/yuval-harpaz/covid-19_data_analysis/blob/master/data/Israel/Israel_ministry_of_health.csv) mild cases are kept in the original form, and is equal to confirmed - recovered - deaths - critical - severe.<br>
* Hebrew translation may differ from site to site. Here:<br>
mild = קל<br>
severe = בינוני<br>
critical = קשה<br>
The definition is given in a [pdf](https://data.gov.il/dataset/f54e79b2-3e6b-4b65-a857-f93e47997d9c/resource/25343697-571b-4180-b482-61fcd08071b4/download/readme-.pdf) file, were critical (hard, literaly) is defined as respiratory or circulatory failure, severe (middle, moderate) is when antibiotics or other care other than pills is required, such as inhalation, intravenous medication or non-invasive oxygene. mild (light, easy) is when the simptoms are light and require no medical attention.
